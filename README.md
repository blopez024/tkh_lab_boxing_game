# Boxing Game Exercise

## Demonstrable Skills

- Apply if, else if, and else statements to handle different gameplay scenarios (e.g., basic hit, critical hit, knockout) to exemplify understanding of conditional branching

- By using conditionals to determine game outcomes and player health status, students will problem-solve and troubleshoot their projects to create functional gameplay via the VSCode terminal


## Overall Gameplay

Below is an explanation of how the game works. It will breakdown how the hits are delivered and how each hit differs in the damage delivered.

- Players take turns delivering damage to their opponent. Damage is randomly set between 1 and 10 points.
- Basic Hit: Damage less than 6.
- Critical Hit: Damage between 6 and 9 (inclusive).
- Knockout: Damage equal to 10.
- If either player's health drops to 0 or below, they are knocked out, and the game ends.

## Expected Output
When the program runs, it alternates hits between the two boxers, displaying the results of each hit until one boxer is knocked out. Below you can see the desired output you should find in your VSCode terminal.
